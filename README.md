# WZAutomation Lib
WZAutomation library for machine automation, logistics, and more.

TIA Portal Version: V19
Test PLC: S7-1500 (PLCSim Advanced V6.0)

Why SCL?
SCL allows easier transformation to ST hence future ST library is possible.

From Author:
I like working with SIEMENS Automation products but at work, I'm using B&R. To keep myself sharp, I 
started this repo. to implement whatever idea I have at work. Therefore, this library is not well
organized. Instead, it will be just scattered FBs for individual functions/function blocks.
